# General API Overview (Application Programming Interface)
- interface (inter: between): a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact.
- API is used generally to refer to a lot of things
- an API abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place (built in javascript methods, jQuery is a library but it's documentation refers to jQuery API)

# A: Application
- A piece of software with a distinct function.
  - any piece of software that can be distinctively separated from its environment
- The whole server, the whole app, or just a small part of an app.

# Browser APIs
- not part of the JavaScript language itself, rather they are built on top of the core JavaScript language (often use lower level coding languages behind the scenes)
- DOM (Document Object Model) API
- `<audio>` and `<video>` HTML elements are part of `HTMLMediaElement` API

# Servers
- An API isn’t the same as the remote server — rather it is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses.
- an API can return just data, or code for displaying a webpage
- It’s not uncommon for development teams to break up their application into multiple servers that talk to each other via APIs. The servers that perform helper functions for the main application server are commonly referred to as microservices.

# Real World Examples
- "As a real-world example, think about the electricity supply in your house, apartment, or other dwellings. If you want to use an appliance in your house, you simply plug it into a plug socket and it works. You don't try to wire it directly into the power supply"
