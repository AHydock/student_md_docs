# RIOTWalk Algo Interview Acronym

## Repeat

- Repeat the question / requirements to verify to yourself and to the interviewer that you understand it
- use this time to clarify any ambiguity / confusion

---

## Input

- Write out some example inputs

---

## Output

- Write out what the output should be for each input and get confirmation from the interviewer that this is what they are looking for. This also helps verify you understand the problem before you start going down the wrong path while writing a solution

---

## Walk

- Before you start writing, **walk** through your initial though process on how to approach the problem, check to see how the interviewer reacts to your thought process, they want to see how you think and communicate code concepts and approaches, but they also might reveal a facial expression that alerts you that your approach has a problem or is going down a completely wrong path
- Start coding, then **walk** through your solution with test cases when finished
- You can also ask if they want you to optimize for time or for space, but if it's a hard problem it could be better to just get any solution down then discuss optimization later

---

## Code Solution

- KEEP **walk**ing through your thought process every step of the way
- start with some pseudo code to get the most important logic down before you get bogged down in small details if it's a complex problem, e.g., just writing `iterate(list)` instead of writing out a full loop then write indented comments below for what you want to do in the loop until you have basic outline down that you can fill in with the fine details
- asterisk any code you are unsure about the syntax or if it works to make sure the interviewer doesn't get the wrong impression thinking that you are overly confident about things that you are not confident about
  - you can also double check with the interviewer on some syntax or what order the arguments go in if you forget, they will often help because they'd rather see you focus on the meat of the problem
- leave a lot of space between lines to make it easy to edit on the whiteboard
- you can draw vertical lines for indendation to help you stay organized and remember to close brackets / braces / parenthesis

---

## Walk through your solution with test cases

- use a T diagram of the variables if necessary

---

## Optimization

- discuss the time / space complexity of your solution ([Big O Notation](https://github.com/TheCodingDojo/student_md_docs/blob/master/CA-OC/bigO.md)) and any ideas you have to further optimize it for either time or space to see if they want you to optimize it more
- often the interviewer will throw in some extra requirements after you solve it to see if you can adapt
