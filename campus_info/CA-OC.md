### Weekends & Holidays

- Doors are locked, you will need to coordinate with the students who have shared key fobs.

## Shared Keys

- There are 3 shared key fobs that students are responsible for coordinating amongst each other to come in early / stay late.

### Keyholder's Responsibilities

- **Possessing a shared key is a responsibility**.
- Your name & phone number must be written on the white board if you have a key.
- **You are responsible for prompty responding** to student's questions about when / if you will be on site so they know if they can depend on you to be let in.
- If you cannot be there to let in a student in that is trying to plan to come in early / stay late, give them the key until you need it back.
- If instructors hear that students are having a hard time coordinating with a keyholder, the keyholder will be required to give up their key to someone else who has been trying to come early / stay late.
